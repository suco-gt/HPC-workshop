# HPC 101

This folder contains the exercises for the first instructional part of the session. You'll be prompted to look at different exercises in this folder during the session. 

First, log onto the ICE cluster with the following command, where ``<username>`` is your GT username.
```bash
ssh <username>@login-ice.pace.gatech.edu
```
If you haven't already, please run the following code to fork the repository that you'll be using today. 
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/suco-gt/HPC-workshop
ls | grep workshop 
```
If the repository is present, this should print the repository name. If not, please let us know. If this code runs, go ahead and run the following code, which will enter the workshop folder, which is now stored on the cluster.
```
cd HPC-workshop
```
