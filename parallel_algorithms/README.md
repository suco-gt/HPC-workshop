There are 6 exercises in this directory that cover the following topics:
1. Basics of MPI - seeing parallel processes say hello
2. Basics of OpenMP - parallel threads say hello and parallelized vector addition
3. Estimating value of pi using Monte Carlo algorithm (MPI)
4. Performing parallel prefix sum on an array of numbers (MPI)
5. Building on the previous prefix sum code to compute sums when the number of processes is not a power of 2
6. Applying Bellman Ford algorithm on graphs to find the shortest path (OpenMP)

Each has its corresponding README for more details on the problem and how it is executed.

Solve the ones you would like to, but following the given order is recommended. Some of them are to be executed on your local machine, and others on the ice cluster.

Please follow the instructions in each folder to complete the codes and play around with the output.
Enjoy!
